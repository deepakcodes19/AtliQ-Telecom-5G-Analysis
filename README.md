AtliQ Telecom 5G Launch Analysis
Problem Statement
AtliQo, one of India's leading telecom providers, launched its 5G plans in May 2022, alongside other telecom providers. Since the launch, there has been a noticeable decline in active users and revenue growth. The business director has tasked the analytics team with providing a comparison report of key performance indicators (KPIs) between the periods before and after the 5G launch. The goal is to evaluate the performance during these two periods and derive insights that can help recover active user rates and improve other critical metrics. Additionally, the company is exploring ways to optimize their internet plans to attract more active users.

Market Position: AtliQo continues to hold the third position in the market, with no significant change in market share, reflecting a stable competitive standing.
Top-Performing Plans: Plans 1, 2, and 11 have emerged as the highest-performing plans, suggesting that these offerings are key to the company's success and could be leveraged for further growth.
Pune User Growth: Pune has experienced an 18% growth in active users, despite a significant 55% increase in unsubscribed users. This suggests that while churn is a concern, there is still strong growth potential in the region.
Conclusion
This analysis provides a comprehensive view of AtliQo’s 5G launch performance. Despite a slight decline in revenue and user retention, the increase in ARPU and significant growth in regions like Pune suggest opportunities for targeted strategies. By focusing on optimizing key offerings and addressing regional challenges, AtliQo can potentially recover lost ground and further solidify its competitive position in the telecom market.
